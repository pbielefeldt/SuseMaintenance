### Still to do manually:
# Set up Dropbox
# Skype (skype4pidgin is already there)
# Spotify
# Tor Browser

### Other things to do
# remove the installation medium from active repos:
#     YaST/Repositories/"URL=hd...= -> Delete
# switch off the Grub2 chosing screen:
#     YaST/Bootloader/Bootloader-Options/Timeout -> 0
# Give Snapper sane defaults:
#     In /etc/snapper/configs/root
#     Set NUMBER_LIMIT="6", NUMBER_LIMIT_IMPORTANT="3"
